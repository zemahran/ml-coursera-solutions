My solutions for the "Machine Learning by Stanford" course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

I have included all the needed functions as [local functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/local-functions.html) at the end of the script of every exercise instead of saving each one of them separately, but this demands R2016b or higher. It is best to view scripts as [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-live-scripts.html) for convenience.

This is a work-in-progress.
