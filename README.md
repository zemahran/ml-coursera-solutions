My solutions for the "Machine Learning by Stanford" course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

I have included all the needed functions at the end of the script of every exercise instead of saving each one of them separately. It is best to view scripts as [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html) for convenience.

This is a work-in-progress.
